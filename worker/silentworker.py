    This is the baseline for the SilentWorker.

    SilentWorker should be the one carrying the main work.
    Sometimes a module might take a great deal of time to generate outputs. 

    Whenever your model finishes an operation, make sure to call `__onFinish__` function to populate your results to db as well as to the next module in the chain.
        Command:
            self.__onFinish__(output[, note])

        whereas:
            - output (mandatory): A dict that maps a `orig_input_hash` => output
                Output could be of any type. Just make sure to note that in your module's configuration and description for others to interpret your results.
                For example,
                    - a detector module can return a boolean (to represent detection result).
                    - a non-detector module (eg. processor or sandbox) can return the path storing processed result.
                eg.
                    {
                        'hash_of_input_1': true,
                        'hash_of_input_2': false,
                        'hash_of_input_3': false,
                        ...
                    }
            - note (optional).
                It could be a dict or a string.
                If it's a dict, it must be a map of a filepath to a note (string). The system will find and save the note accordingly with the file. 
                If it's not a map, use a string. The system will save this note for all the files analyzed in this batch
